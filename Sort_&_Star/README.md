To understand what values min() will return from a string, you need to understand how Python sorts characters in general. By default, the Python min() function uses ASCII sort order to sort strings. If you examine the ASCII table, then you'll see that special characters like exclamation marks ('!') and dollar signs ('$') come before alphabet characters.
